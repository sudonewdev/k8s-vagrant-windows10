
## Fully Automated Vagrant Kubernetes Cluster Setup, with one master and 'N' workers for VirtualBox

Special thanks to [Salah-Eddine Gassim](https://github.com/vNugget), have
used his [repo](https://github.com/vNugget/Kubernetes/tree/main/AutoKube) as template

This will install:

- The Kubernetes version (currently 1.21.2)
- Docker as a container runtime
- Calico as a CNI.

Tested on:
```
Windows 10
Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop
```
## Requirements

You have to install:
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) 
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

## How To Use It

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sudonewdev/k8s-vagrant-windows10
```

```bash
cd k8s-vagrant-windows10
```

```bash
vagrant up
```
```bash
vagrant ssh master-1
```
After this stage you can use kubectl

```
âžœ  kubectl get nodes
NAME       STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
master     Ready    control-plane,master   65m   v1.20.0
worker-1   Ready    <none>                 62m   v1.20.0
worker-2   Ready    <none>                 59m   v1.20.0
```
